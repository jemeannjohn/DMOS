//File Transfer

The messages sent are arrays of 10 integers
	1) 1st integer in the array sent by client has the reply port
	2) 2nd interger is the opcode of the operation that needs to be performed
		* 0 -> file open
		* 1 -> file write
		* 2 -> file close
	3) the messages are encoded in two ways
		* for file names we group 4 characters into a single integer
		* for file write each integer in message represents a character in the file
	the 2 methods are used for encoding to exhibit the 2 possibilities of representing characters as integers
